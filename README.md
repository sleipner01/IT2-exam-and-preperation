# About this repo
This repo contains the work I did towards the exam of IT2, an optional course at the third year of high-school in Norway.
I did not follow the standard lectures, but learned the curriculum in half a year with some of my friends. We took both a written exam and an oral-exam in the winter to pass the course.
